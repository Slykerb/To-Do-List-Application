Introduction (Heading 1) Abstract Task management is an essential component of productivity in both personal and professional settings. Many individuals struggle with keeping track of their tasks, leading to inefficiencies and missed deadlines. This project presents a C++-based to-do list application designed to help users efficiently organize their tasks. The application allows users to create, categorize, prioritize, and update tasks dynamically. By implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the system ensures modularity and scalability. This paper discusses the system's architecture, key features, and benefits, highlighting its role in enhancing task management. 

Introduction Task management is a fundamental aspect of maintaining efficiency in personal and professional life. As responsibilities and commitments increase, individuals often find it challenging to track their tasks effectively. A lack of an organized system can result in missed deadlines, decreased productivity, and increased stress. The need for an intuitive and efficient tool to manage tasks is more critical than ever. 

This project introduces a to-do list application developed using C++, designed to provide users with a streamlined method for managing their daily tasks. The primary goal of this project is to offer users an efficient system that allows them to organize their tasks, set priorities, and keep track of pending and completed activities.  

The application features a structured approach to task organization, allowing users to add, remove, and modify tasks based on priority and category. Utilizing object-oriented programming concepts, the system ensures flexibility and maintainability by incorporating encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The inclusion of a user-friendly command-line interface allows seamless interaction with the application. 

Additionally, the system employs efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure quick task retrieval and optimized memory usage. File handling techniques enable users to save and retrieve their tasks, ensuring data persistence across multiple sessions. This project aims to provide a practical tool that enhances productivity by simplifying task management, helping users stay organized and meet their deadlines effectively.  

 

[1] J. Han, H. Kim, and S. Park, “TaskDo: A daily task recommender system” 
 This paper helped us understand how tasks can be managed and recommended in a structured way, which influenced how we thought about organizing tasks in a queue or stack. 

[2] P. J. Bayliss and H. L. Ellis, “Right light at the right time...” 
 Although more complex, this work inspired us to think about timing in task organization, even in our simpler setup. 

[3] A. Kumar, R. Jain, and P. Sharma, “Gamification-based to-do list mobile application development” 
 This paper showed how adding simple motivational features (like checking off tasks) can make a basic task list more engaging. 

[4] K. Nishida and K. Matsuo, “Where can we accomplish our to-do?” 
 It gave us ideas about how task context (like location or order) could be considered, even in a basic queue or stack setup. 

[5] S. Smith and T. Brown, “AI-assisted task management...” 
 While more advanced, this paper emphasized the importance of structured task management, which we apply in our basic design using stack or queue logic.
